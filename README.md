# Donation Campaign - NES RetroAchievements Adapter 
[![pt-br](https://img.shields.io/badge/lang-pt--br-green.svg)](https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter-donation-campaign/blob/main/README.pt-br.md)

## Bringing Retro Achievements to the Original Console

Imagine being able to **unlock achievements** while playing on your **original NES**, just like you can on emulators. Thanks to a passionate retro gaming community and the infrastructure provided by RetroAchievements, our project aims to make this a reality: bringing community-mapped achievements to the physical NES, allowing players to earn them **using original cartridges**.

---

-> **You can build yours right now!** <- All code, circuit schematics, everything is shared [here](https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter)!

**Want to help?**

- **Donate to our campaign** (ends at the end of April) and help us **deliver it as we envisioned**, miniaturized, with a 3D case, and usable without opening the console.
- Help **spread the word about the project** and campaign!
- Build, use, test, and **be part of the project** ^.^

## Our Journey and Challenges

So far, we have invested approximately **U$1.333** (R$8000) mainly with hardware (PCBs, microcontrollers, import taxes to Brazil, etc), not to mention countless hours of development and testing. Our prototype is already capable of:

- **Identifying the inserted cartridge**;
- **Logging into RetroAchievements** and fetching game data;
- **Inspecting the cartridgeâ€™s memory** to interface with the achievement system using the rcheevos library;
- **Providing a web-based configuration interface**, guiding users to input their Wi-Fi and RetroAchievements credentials.

- and ultimately, - **Detect Achievements and Upload them to RetroAchievements ðŸ™Œ**;

The next step is to refine this prototype into a **final, accessible form** â€“ with a miniaturized PCB, 3D-printed cases, and an optimized design â€“ so that any retro gaming enthusiast can build or acquire their own adapter.

---

## Goals of This Campaign

We aim to raise **U$3.333** (R$20,000.00) to:

- **Cover past and future hardware expenses** necessary to complete the final prototype.
- **Develop a miniaturized PCB** and a 3D-printed case with a design inspired by the classic Game Genie.

## Transparency and Open Source Sharing

We are committed to transparency and collaboration. Thatâ€™s why **on the first day of the campaign, on 03/29, we will share all project materials**. This includes:

- Complete source code;
- PCB schematics (including prototypes);
- 3D models for case printing;
- Documentation.

<p align="center">
  <img width="50%" src="https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter-donation-campaign/blob/main/images/share.png"/>
</p>

This way, any enthusiast can build their own adapter using a breadboard or prototype PCBs, contribute improvements, and potentially develop new versions for other consoles.

## How the Funds Will Be Spent

The money raised will be divided between **odelot** and **gh**. All expenses so far have been covered by **odelot**, and **gh** will be responsible for the next phase, including refining the hardware and miniaturizing it to fit the size of a Game Genie cartridge. This will involve:

- Creating prototypes;
- Fabricating the PCB;
- Purchasing additional hardware;
- Creating test prototypes for community feedback;
- And covering any unforeseen costs during the development process.

---

## How it works

- it works similar to a Game Genie, but instead of altering the values from the cartridge, it watches every write on the memory to detect the achievements.
- It also adds Internet to NES, because it is necessary for interfacing with RetroAchievements in real-time.
- The user interface is made by the tiny LCD, the buzzer and also by the smartphone screen (to configure the adapter with your wifi and RetroAchievements credentials).
- It identifies the cartridge reading its content and intrepret the achievements using RA [rcheevos](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/rcheevos) library (awesome lib btw).
- It uses Raspberry Pico and ESP32 instead of a FPGA and it is affordable (~ U$20 in parts, excluding PCB, 3D case, shipping fees and import taxes)

## Limitations

Weâ€™ve already encountered a few challenges during development:

- **Testing with various games**: We've tested the adapter with around 50 games. While the vast majority of games we tested worked correctly, two had issues. Please see the [compatibility page](https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter-donation-campaign/blob/main/Compatibility.md) to see which games we have tested and which ones we had issues with. We hope to improve the adapter to further increase compatibility.

- **Detecting a frame and reset**: We are unable to detect a frame just inspecting the signals of the cartridge. We use a heuristic that gave us very good results (until now, we couldn't notice a miss achievement), but it is not guaranteed this will work for all achievements ever created (example: two delta operators in the same achievement could be challenging). If this happens in the future, we can try to improve our heuristics. We also cannot detect a Console RESET yet, so for the adapter to work like an emulator with RetroAchievements, it will be necessary to turn off/on the console.
  
- **Server Response Size**: The amount of RAM available for the response from RetroAchievements, that contains the list of achievements and memory addresses to monitor, is currently **32KB**. We will make available an AWS lambda function source code to remove unused fields or some achievements to reduce the response size and fit within the 32KB limit.

## Support and Updates

We want to keep the community engaged and informed throughout the development process. Therefore:

- Weâ€™ll be hosting a **Discord channel** where you can ask questions, share feedback, and stay updated. [Join the Channel](https://discord.gg/9atpm3BR)

- A **FAQ section** will be available here as soon as the questions arrives.

- We will continue to **share details about the development process** throughout the campaign (starting in April), including progress updates, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

### Schedule

- **03/29:** Official launch of the campaign and release of all project material (source code, schematics, 3D models, documentation).

- **April:** Improvement of documentation - necessary optimizations in software

- **April - June:** Iterations in the development, miniaturization and improvement of the hardware part, mainly in the PCB design and 3D modeling of the case

## Who We Are

### <img src="https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter-donation-campaign/blob/main/images/profileOdelot.png" width="75px"> odelot

A Computer Science graduate, **odelot** dedicated several months of his sabbatical to studying NES architecture and developing the hardware and firmware for the adapter. He was responsible for creating the prototypes that proved the concept and also designed the 3D-printed case.

### <img src="https://github.com/odelot/nes-ra-adapter-donation-campaign/blob/main/images/profileGH.png" width="75px"> GH

An Electrical Engineer and expert in analog audio circuits, **gh** contributes his expertise in circuit validation and innovative problem-solving. He will be responsible for designing the miniaturized adapterâ€™s PCBs, which will take the form of a **cartridge similar to the Game Genie**.

## A Call to the Community

This project is driven by a passion for retro gaming and a commitment to preserving the legacy of classic consoles. Instead of simply producing and delivering the adapter to the community, **we believe that the true strength comes from everyoneâ€™s collaboration**. The **community** has so much to offer, and we want everyone to **contribute ideas**, **improve the project with new features**, **fix bugs**, and ultimately **evolve the project together**.

Moreover, we believe this adapter is just the beginning. What weâ€™re creating is not just a product, but **a foundation for new adapters** that could be used on other retro consoles, such as the SNES, MegaDrive/Genesis, PS1, and more. With everyoneâ€™s support and open-source code, we can build something bigger and better than what could be accomplished if we were doing it alone.

**Join us on this journey!** Your contribution, whether financial support or active participation in development, brings us closer to turning this dream into reality, with the quality and transparency the community deserves.
